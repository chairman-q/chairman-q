I’m @chairman-q, but you can call me Q for short.

- Novice graphic & UI designer (mostly minimalistic styles)
- Former Python programmer, used to have done some pretty interesting stuff with it (e.g. using Python to build in Minecraft)
- Former C# programmer (only because it's a requirement for a district competition)
- Professionally utilised Pascal for city-wide academic competitions before (I wholeheartedly hate it and do not wish to use it again)
- Average Blender & Photoshop enjoyed (I don't use these at professional level; however, I can still do some commissions if needed)
- Self-taught project manager (basically a cooler way of saying I fucked up my projects many times before and learned from those experiences)
- Looking to learn how to use Lua, Roblox Luau, and maybe Java
